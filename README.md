# Price Model

A decentralized smart contract framework for dynamic pricing and valuation mechanisms on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

Price Model provides a flexible and transparent system for implementing complex pricing strategies using blockchain technology. By leveraging Clarity smart contracts, this project enables:

- Dynamic price calculation
- Transparent pricing mechanisms
- Configurable valuation models
- Secure and immutable price tracking

## Smart Contracts

### Price Oracle (`price-oracle`)

The core contract managing price calculations and valuation strategies.

Key features:
- Multiple price input sources
- Configurable calculation methods
- Price history tracking
- Anti-manipulation safeguards

### Pricing Strategies (`pricing-strategies`)

Handles different pricing models and valuation algorithms.

Key features:
- Linear and exponential pricing models
- Time-based price adjustments
- Volume-weighted pricing
- Custom price curve implementations

### Price Registry (`price-registry`)

Manages and stores price information across different assets and markets.

Key features:
- Multi-asset price tracking
- Timestamp and version management
- Price validation and verification
- Market-specific pricing data

## Getting Started

To integrate Price Model into your blockchain application:

1. Deploy the core contracts to the Stacks blockchain
2. Configure your desired pricing strategy
3. Set up price input sources
4. Initialize price tracking for specific assets

## Usage Examples

### Registering a New Asset Price
```clarity
(contract-call? .price-oracle register-asset
    "BTC"       ;; Asset symbol
    u100000     ;; Price in cents
    tx-sender   ;; Price source
)
```

### Calculating Dynamic Price
```clarity
(contract-call? .pricing-strategies calculate-price
    "asset-token"
    u1000       ;; Base volume
    block-height ;; Current block
)
```

## Security Considerations

- Input validation for price sources
- Rate limiting on price updates
- Multi-source price verification
- Configurable trust thresholds
